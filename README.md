# AWS VIP Behavior App
Create a scalable digital solution which allows:

Guests of the hotel to express which behaviors they would like the hotel to display in interactions with them, and give feedback on how those were actualized.

Provide the hotel with more quantifiable and actionable feedback, as well as more targeted and focused data, and identifying training gaps and calibrating assumptions.

Collect data, both to create training programs and provide behavior insights, which can be later monetized.

## How hotels system interacts with “Behavioral OS”
The hotels project of VIP behaviors is part of a larger concept, where the 48 behavior “universal behavior matrix” is used as a basis for apps for all different industries.

One of the objectives is to be able to collect data from all of those apps, and use that data to form cross-industry/international insights into behaviors for use in training programs and monetization.

This means all projects must be connected to “behavioral OS”, a master database, which provides the original 48 behaviors, as well as collects data collected through any apps based on that behavioral matrix.
